/**
 * Desires (or, more commonly though somewhat loosely, Goals) form another essential
component of system state. Again, in computational terms, a Goal may simply be
the value of a variable, a record structure, or a symbolic expression in some logic. The
important point is that a Goal represents some desired end state. Conventional computer
software is ”task oriented” rather than ”goal oriented”; that is, each task (or subroutine)
is executed without any memory of why it is being executed. This means that the system
cannot automatically recover from failures (unless this is explicitly coded by the
programmer) and cannot discover and make use of opportunities as they unexpectedly
present themselves.
